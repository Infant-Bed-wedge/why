<section id="introduction">
    <p>Those long nights with my crying baby nearly broke me. Every time I laid my little one down, the spit-up and crying would start all over again. If you're dealing with a fussy, uncomfortable baby who can't seem to sleep because of acid reflux, I completely understand your struggle.</p>
    
    <p>Today, I want to share how an infant GERD wedge pillow changed everything for us. Specifically, I'll introduce you to Reflux Guard, the solution that finally helped my baby (and me!) get some much-needed sleep.</p>

    <h2>What Is Infant GERD? (I Had No Idea Until It Happened to Us)</h2>
    
    <p>When my pediatrician first mentioned "GERD," I was confused. She explained that GERD stands for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. In simple words, it's when stuff from your baby's tummy flows back up into their food pipe. This happens because the muscle that keeps food down isn't fully developed in babies.</p>
    
    <p>I noticed these signs in my baby:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spitting up much more than normal babies</li>
        <li>Crying and arching his back during or after feeding</li>
        <li>Refusing to eat but acting hungry</li>
        <li>Coughing or choking sounds</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping, especially when laid flat</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The worst part? My baby wasn't sleeping well, which meant I wasn't sleeping either. He seemed uncomfortable all the time, and I felt helpless watching him struggle.</p>

    <h2>Why Your Baby's Sleep Position Really Matters with GERD</h2>
    
    <p>During one of our many doctor visits, I learned something that changed everything. "Gravity is your friend," our pediatrician told me. She explained that keeping my baby's upper body slightly higher than his legs could help keep stomach acid down where it belongs.</p>
    
    <p>I tried propping up the crib mattress with towels, but it wasn't stable. I tried holding my baby upright after feedings, but I couldn't stay awake all night. That's when I started looking for a safer solution and found out about wedge pillows designed for babies with reflux.</p>
    
    <div class="expert-quote">
        <p>"Elevating the head of the crib by about 30 degrees can help reduce reflux symptoms in infants. This uses gravity to help keep stomach contents where they belong."</p>

    <h2>Infant GERD Wedge Pillows: The Safe Sleep Solution I Discovered</h2>
    
    <img src="https://www.refluxguard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/under-mattress-bed-wedge-cloud-1024x654-1.png" alt="Reflux Guard Wedge Pillow Under Mattress" width="100%" height="auto">
    
    <p>An infant GERD wedge pillow is a firm, sloped cushion that goes under your baby's mattress (not directly under the baby). It creates a gentle slope that helps keep stomach acid down while your baby sleeps.</p>
    
    <p>After trying one, I noticed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Much less spit-up during the night</li>
        <li>My baby slept for longer stretches</li>
        <li>Less crying and fussing after feedings</li>
        <li>I finally got some sleep too!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>But I want to be super clear: These wedges go UNDER the mattress, not in the crib with your baby. Safe sleep rules still apply - babies should always sleep on their backs on a firm, flat surface with nothing else in the crib.</p>

    <h2>Why I Chose Reflux Guard for My Baby's GERD</h2>
    
    <p>After trying different solutions, I finally found Reflux Guard, and I wish I'd discovered it sooner! It's specially made for babies with reflux problems, and here's why I think it's the best option:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Super Safe Materials</strong>: It's made with breathable, hypoallergenic foam that doesn't contain any harmful chemicals. I'm really careful about what touches my baby's sleep space!</li>
        <li><strong>Perfect Angle</strong>: The 15-degree incline is just right - enough to help with reflux but not so steep that my baby slides down.</li>
        <li><strong>Fits Perfectly</strong>: It slides right under the crib mattress and stays in place all night. No more DIY towel props that kept slipping!</li>
        <li><strong>Easy to Clean</strong>: The cover zips off and can go in the washing machine - super important when dealing with spit-up!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I especially love that it works with our existing crib and doesn't require buying a whole new sleep system.</p>

    <h2>How Reflux Guard Changed Our Nights</h2>
    
    <p>The first night we used our Reflux Guard wedge, I was amazed at the difference. My baby still had reflux, but the gentle incline helped keep the acid down in his tummy where it belonged.</p>
    
    <p>I noticed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My baby woke up less during the night</li>
        <li>His clothes and sheets weren't soaked with spit-up every morning</li>
        <li>He seemed more comfortable during and after feedings</li>
        <li>I felt less worried watching him sleep</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>After a few weeks of using it, my baby's GERD symptoms started getting better overall. Our doctor explained that consistent positioning plus time (as his digestive system matures) makes a big difference.</p>

    <h2>Using an Infant GERD Wedge Safely (What My Pediatrician Told Me)</h2>
    
    <p>Safety always comes first with babies! Here's what I learned about using a wedge pillow safely:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Always place the wedge UNDER the mattress</strong>, never directly under your baby</li>
        <li><strong>Keep following safe sleep rules</strong>: baby on their back, nothing else in the crib</li>
        <li><strong>Make sure the mattress stays firmly in place</strong> on top of the wedge</li>
        <li><strong>Check with your doctor first</strong> before using any sleep positioning product</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>My pediatrician reminded me that while a wedge can help with reflux symptoms, it's not a substitute for medical treatment if my baby has severe GERD. Always talk to your doctor about a complete care plan.</p>

    <h2>Questions I Had About Infant GERD Wedge Pillows (Maybe You Have Them Too)</h2>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h3>Does my baby really need a wedge pillow?</h3>
        <p>Not every baby with occasional spit-up needs a wedge. But if your baby has been diagnosed with GERD or has frequent uncomfortable reflux that affects their sleep, a wedge like Reflux Guard might help. I wish I hadn't waited so long to try one!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h3>Is Reflux Guard easy to clean?</h3>
        <p>Yes! This was super important to me. The cover zips off and is machine washable. The foam core can be spot cleaned if needed. With all the spit-up happening, being able to keep it clean was a must for me.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h3>How long will my baby need to use a wedge pillow?</h3>
        <p>Every baby is different. My little one needed it for about 6 months. Many babies outgrow GERD between 6-12 months as their digestive systems mature. Your pediatrician can help you decide when it's time to transition away from using the wedge.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h3>Will this fix my baby's reflux completely?</h3>
        <p>I found the wedge helped reduce symptoms, but it wasn't a magic cure. For us, it was part of a bigger plan that included smaller, more frequent feedings, holding upright after meals, and medication prescribed by our doctor. The wedge was most helpful for nighttime sleep.</p>
